# Live Deploy Runbook

This is the shortest practical runbook for normal future work.

If you only remember one thing, remember this:

- `dev` = active development
- `staging` = stable preview
- `main` = production
- normal promotion path: `dev -> staging -> main`

## Golden Path

- local work happens on `dev`
- normal work starts on `dev`
- `staging` and `main` are promotion branches during normal flow
- reviewed work is promoted to `staging`
- staging is published from `staging`
- production is published from `main`
- GitHub publishes prebuilt `cpanel-*` branches
- cPanel clones plus cron apply those branches on the current host

Do not start routine feature work on `main`.
Use `main` as a starting point only for an emergency production hotfix.

Canonical pieces:

- workflow:
  - [.github/workflows/publish-cpanel-prebuilt-v2.yml](../../.github/workflows/publish-cpanel-prebuilt-v2.yml)
- release bundle:
  - `.deploy/cpanel/`
- apply script:
  - [scripts/cpanel-apply-prebuilt-release.sh](../../scripts/cpanel-apply-prebuilt-release.sh)

## Shortcut Commands

From the repo root:

```bash
npm run deploy:status
npm run deploy:dev
npm run deploy:staging
npm run deploy:production
npm run deploy:host:staging
npm run deploy:host:production
```

Equivalent single helper form:

```bash
npm run deploy -- status
npm run deploy -- staging
npm run deploy -- production
npm run deploy -- host staging
npm run deploy -- host production
```

Rules:

- `dev` is the integration lane only and does not deploy to hosting directly
- run `deploy:dev` and `deploy:staging` from a clean `dev` branch
- `deploy:production` fast-forwards `main` when possible, or creates a merge commit on top of `main` that prefers `staging` on conflicting hunks if `main` and `staging` have both moved
- `deploy:host:*` is only for the matching cPanel clone or host shell
- `deploy:remote:*` is optional for a future SSH-capable host and is not part of the current shared-host flow
- `npm run deploy -- smoke staging` and `npm run deploy -- smoke production` are the quick verification commands

Current host truth:

- use `npm run deploy:staging` from your laptop
- verify staging
- use `npm run deploy:production` from your laptop
- cPanel cron applies the published `cpanel-*` branches automatically

Future SSH/VPS staging path:

- [.github/workflows/deploy-staging-ssh.yml](../../.github/workflows/deploy-staging-ssh.yml)
- [SSH_STAGING_DEPLOY.md](SSH_STAGING_DEPLOY.md)
- disabled by default until `ENABLE_SSH_STAGING_DEPLOY=true` and staging SSH secrets are configured

## Auto Apply Via Cron

If the host does not allow SSH but does allow cPanel `Terminal` and `Cron Jobs`, use:

```bash
cd /home/distudio/repositories/di.iiii-staging
bash scripts/cpanel-poll-deploy.sh staging
```

```bash
cd /home/distudio/repositories/di.iiii-production
bash scripts/cpanel-poll-deploy.sh production
```

Suggested cron entries:

```cron
*/2 * * * * cd /home/distudio/repositories/di.iiii-staging && bash scripts/cpanel-poll-deploy.sh staging >> /home/distudio/logs/staging-auto-deploy.log 2>&1
*/2 * * * * cd /home/distudio/repositories/di.iiii-production && bash scripts/cpanel-poll-deploy.sh production >> /home/distudio/logs/production-auto-deploy.log 2>&1
```

This is pull-based auto-deploy rather than SSH push deploy, but on this host it is the simplest fully repeatable option.

## Daily Workflow

Typical start-of-session commands:

```bash
git switch dev
git pull --ff-only origin dev
npm run dev
```

### To update staging

1. Promote the approved source code:

```bash
npm run deploy:staging
```

2. Wait about 1-2 minutes for GitHub publish plus cPanel cron.

3. Verify:

```bash
curl -s https://staging.di-studio.xyz/serverXR/api/health
npm run smoke:cpanel -- --base-url https://staging.di-studio.xyz
```

### To update production

1. Promote the already verified `staging` branch into `main`:

```bash
npm run deploy:production
```

2. Wait about 1-2 minutes for GitHub publish plus cPanel cron.

3. Verify:

```bash
curl -s https://di-studio.xyz/serverXR/api/health
npm run smoke:cpanel -- --base-url https://di-studio.xyz
```

If the helper cannot merge `staging` into `main` even with staging-preferred conflict resolution, stop and resolve the branch drift before shipping.

## What Is Automatic Today

- GitHub-side prebuilt publish is automatic on pushes to `staging` and `main`
- the prebuilt branches are:
  - `cpanel-staging`
  - `cpanel-production`
- `workflow_dispatch` exists for repair or recovery work, but it should not replace the normal `dev -> staging -> main` promotion flow

## Emergency Hotfix Path

When production needs an urgent fix, start from `main`, then bring the same commit back into `staging` and `dev` so the branches do not drift apart.

## What May Still Be Manual

- first-time cron setup in cPanel
- host recovery when a cPanel clone diverges
- manual cPanel apply if cron is disabled or delayed
- if cPanel says branches diverged, use the reset recovery steps in [cPanel Prebuilt Deploy](CPANEL_PREBUILT_DEPLOY.md)

## Runtime Contract

- `/serverXR` stays owned by the cPanel Node.js App
- frontend lives in the web root
- backend lives in `serverXR` or `serverXR-staging`
- shared schema files live outside the backend repo copy and must be pointed to with `SHARED_ROOT`
- staging and production do not automatically share media/content

Per environment keep these aligned:

- `APP_BASE_PATH=/serverXR`
- `DATA_ROOT=<environment specific>`
- `SHARED_ROOT=<environment specific>`
- `CORS_ORIGINS=<environment specific>`
- `API_TOKEN` and `VITE_API_TOKEN` must match

## Public Surfaces

- public app: `https://your-domain/`
- public/main route: `https://your-domain/main`
- public/space route: `https://your-domain/<space>`
- admin: `https://your-domain/admin?space=main`
- Studio: `https://your-domain/main/studio`
- Beta: `https://your-domain/main/beta`
- backend monitor: `https://your-domain/serverXR/`
- backend health: `https://your-domain/serverXR/api/health`

## First Checks If Something Breaks

1. `https://<host>/serverXR/api/health`
2. Passenger `.htaccess` inside the web-root `serverXR/` mount
3. backend `.env`
4. `DATA_ROOT` and `SHARED_ROOT`
5. browser console and network panel

## Legacy Fallbacks

These docs still exist for emergency use, but they are not the default future path:

- [docs/deploy/legacy/README.md](legacy/README.md)
- [docs/deploy/legacy/CPANEL_GIT_PULL_DEPLOY.md](legacy/CPANEL_GIT_PULL_DEPLOY.md)
- [docs/deploy/legacy/PM2_QUICK_GUIDE.md](legacy/PM2_QUICK_GUIDE.md)

The old legacy SSH-push GitHub workflows were removed on purpose so the Actions page reflects the real path in use.
