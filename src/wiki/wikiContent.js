            'henry is a short interactive film rather than a game. A very small girl walks through an enormous dream garden, reaches a tree with deer under it, finds a plush bear the size of a hill and brushes its teeth, and then the dream quietly stops being kind. She takes off her glasses and the giant world turns out to be an ordinary room with houseplants in it. She puts them back on. It runs about 1:55.',

                '/henry — the experience. Built the same way as algovrithm: a real space routed through the same server-verified public/private check, whose scene is code in src/henry/ rather than a project document. The Studio editor has nothing to open for this space.',
                'Walk with WASD or the arrow keys, drag to look around, press E when something is waiting. There is no other interface: a soft ring on the ground is the only prompt the piece ever shows, and it appears for exactly one thing at a time.',
                'It is a screen piece, not a headset piece, and deliberately so. The camera performs — it sits below the girl’s shoulder and tilts up to make the world tower over her, and it pulls back and rises for the reveal. Camera moves like that are the whole language of the ending and they are exactly what you must never do to someone wearing a headset, so there is no Enter VR here. A VR cut would need a different camera contract (the world moves, the viewer never does) and would be a different edit, not a flag.'
            ] },
            'The piece is six beats on one playhead, in src/henry/timeline.js. Some beats end on the clock; others run their animation and then WAIT for the player, holding their final state until the interaction happens. So a visitor who plays along sees a two-minute film and a visitor who wanders off and looks at a flower for five minutes never sees it break — the world just keeps breathing until they arrive. No timer is shown and nothing can be failed.',
            'Everything the scene draws is procedural — petals, leaves, blobs and tapers built from parametric surfaces in src/henry/geometry.js. Nothing is loaded from disk. Partly that is so the silhouettes come from the piece’s own references rather than from an asset store, but mostly it is because every giant dream object has to survive being scaled to a fortieth of itself at the reveal and still read as the ordinary thing it turns out to be, and that only works if the shapes were authored as one family with controllable proportions.',
            'The reveal has exactly one trick, and it is in src/henry/dual.js: every giant dream object and the ordinary object it "turns out to be" are the same mesh at two scales. There is no cut, no second scene and no crossfade — the enormous lily and the houseplant by the window are one object, and the transition is an interpolation between its two sizes played while the camera pulls back. Scale interpolates logarithmically rather than linearly, so the world shrinks at a constant rate instead of staying huge and then collapsing in the last few frames. The girl herself never changes size, which is what keeps her animation, her movement and her camera in one unit system for the whole piece.',
            'Three global dials — dream, strange and black — are written once per frame and read by every object in the scene. They live in a mutable ref rather than in React state: in state, moving one flower would re-render the entire dream sixty times a second. React only hears about the piece at all when a beat changes, which is five times in two minutes.',
            'The look is flat painted rather than lit: MeshToonMaterial with a hand-built three-stop ramp, almost no directional light, and a screen-space paper grain over the whole image. The grain is doing more work than it looks — a clean render is the single thing that most reliably makes a stylised scene read as "3D asset" instead of as picture, and it stays on at half strength in the real world too, because it is the piece’s paper rather than the dream’s.'
