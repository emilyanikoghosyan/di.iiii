 * The process documentation as a repulsion field instead of a masonry grid.
 *
 * Same interaction grammar as the rest of the landing: the photos drift on the
 * chaotic sine curves the ambient dots use, the cursor shoves them aside the way
 * it shoves .wcc-circle, and the grayscale -> colour flip is still the payoff
 * gesture the CSS gallery had. Clicking keeps the original meaning (the whole set
 * wakes up in colour) and adds one: the photo you clicked comes to you.
 *
 * ACCESSIBILITY. A canvas is a single opaque node — without help it is a dead
 * zone for anyone not holding a mouse. So the real controls are a hidden button
 * per photo and the canvas is the presentation of them: focusing a button lights
 * its plane, activating it enlarges, Escape closes. Screen readers get a labelled
 * list of thirty photos; keyboard users get a tab order; the 3D just follows.
 *
 * Mobile and prefers-reduced-motion never reach this file — AboutProject renders
 * the CSS masonry instead — so there is no motion path to opt out of here.
